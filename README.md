## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 


### What I learned

This is my first challenge on the Frontend Mentor site.
Doing this I needed to learn about
- GitHub
- How to write READ ME file
- How to center a div element both horizontally and vertically

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.centering_div {
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```


### Continued development

This is the very beginning of my journey. 
I still want to practice HTML and CSS and moving to learn JS in the near future.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This is where I started
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This site helps me a lot solving specific problems
